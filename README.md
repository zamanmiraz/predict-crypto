# 🐶📈 Predict-Doge

A machine-learning project to analyze and forecast Dogecoin (DOGE) prices using historical market data and enriched feature sets.

---

## 📈 Model Results

Four regression models were trained and evaluated on the historical Dogecoin dataset using a 70/30 chronological split. The models leveraged 1-day lag-based features (`market_cap`, `volume`, `volume_DOGE`, `open`, `high`, `low`). Hyperparameter tuning was also performed to optimize performance.

## 🔮 Future Plans

1. **Model Expansion**   
   - Explore **ARIMA**, **Prophet**, and **LSTM** for time-series forecasting.

2. **Enhanced Feature Sets**  
   - Add **multi-lag features** (e.g., 7-day and 30-day lags).  
   - Incorporate **technical indicators** (RSI, MACD) and **sentiment signals** from news/Twitter.

3. **Robust Validation**  
   - Apply **walk-forward cross-validation** to better estimate out-of-sample performance.  
   - Use **backtesting** on historical events (e.g., Elon Musk tweets).

4. **Deployment & Dashboarding**  
   - Build a lightweight **Streamlit** or **Dash** app to visualize live predictions.  
   - Automate daily data fetch and model retraining via GitHub Actions.

5. **Database Enrichment**  
   - Integrate **on-chain metrics** (e.g., transaction volume) and **exchange order-book data**.  
   - Store in a **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** backend for scalability.
