WARNING. Do NOT fall for hype. Don't think you're going to get instantly rich. Don't trust random people offering financial advice. Cryptocurrency is the wild wild west of investing and many people want to take your money and run. You must 'educated' yourself with the good and the bad. You must understand what you're doing.
